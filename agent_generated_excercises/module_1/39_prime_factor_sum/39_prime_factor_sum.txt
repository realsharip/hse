# Title: Prime Factor Sum
# Topic Tags: prime, factor

## Task
Sum all prime factors of N (with repetition). For N ≤ 30.

## Input
An integer N (2 ≤ N ≤ 30).

## Output
Sum of prime factors.

## Examples
Input:
12
Output:
7

Input:
20
Output:
9

Input:
30
Output:
10

## Constraints
- Use only Module_1 concepts: arithmetic operations, modulo, integer division, digit extraction.
- No loops, no conditionals, no lists/tuples/dicts/sets, no user-defined functions.
- Prefer integer math (`//`, `%`) and arithmetic identities over any form of branching.
