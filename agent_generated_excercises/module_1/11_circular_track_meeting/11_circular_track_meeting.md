## 📋 Task Description

Two runners start at position 0 on a circular track of length L. Runner A speed is V1, Runner B speed is V2. When do they meet again at start?
## 📥 Input Format

Three integers: L (track length), V1 (speed 1), V2 (speed 2).
## 📤 Output Format

Time units until both are at position 0 again.
## 💡 Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**
```
100
7
3
```

**Output:**
```
100
### Example 2

**Input:**
```
60
4
6
```

**Output:**
```
30
### Example 3

**Input:**
```
50
5
10
```

**Output:**
```

## ⚠️ Constraints

- Use only Module_1 concepts: arithmetic operations, modulo, integer division, digit extraction.
- No loops, no conditionals, no lists/tuples/dicts/sets, no user-defined functions.
- Prefer integer math (`//`, `%`) and arithmetic identities over any form of branching.

## 🎯 Solution Approach

This exercise focuses on **circular, track** concepts from Module 1. Remember to use only:

- ✅ Basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `//`, `%`, `**`)
- ✅ Input/output functions (`input()`, `print()`, `int()`, `str()`)
- ✅ String operations (concatenation, repetition, slicing)
- ✅ Mathematical reasoning and arithmetic identities

- ❌ **No loops** (`for`, `while`)
- ❌ **No conditionals** (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- ❌ **No collections** (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets)
- ❌ **No user-defined functions**
