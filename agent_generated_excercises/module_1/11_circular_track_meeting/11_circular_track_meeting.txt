## Input
Three integers: L (track length), V1 (speed 1), V2 (speed 2).

## Output
Time units until both are at position 0 again.

## Constraints
- Use only Module_1 concepts: arithmetic operations, modulo, integer division, digit extraction.
- No loops, no conditionals, no lists/tuples/dicts/sets, no user-defined functions.
- Prefer integer math (`//`, `%`) and arithmetic identities over any form of branching.
