# Title: Capacitor Charge Time
# Topic Tags: capacitor, charge

## Task
Capacitor charges to 63% in RC seconds. Given R ohms and C farads, find time.

## Input
Two integers: R (ohms), C (microfarads).

## Output
Time in microseconds.

## Examples
Input:
1000
10
Output:
10000

Input:
500
20
Output:
10000

Input:
2000
5
Output:
10000

## Constraints
- Use only Module_1 concepts: arithmetic operations, modulo, integer division, digit extraction.
- No loops, no conditionals, no lists/tuples/dicts/sets, no user-defined functions.
- Prefer integer math (`//`, `%`) and arithmetic identities over any form of branching.
