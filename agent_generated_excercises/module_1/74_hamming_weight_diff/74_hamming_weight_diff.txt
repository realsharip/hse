# Title: Hamming Weight Diff
# Topic Tags: hamming, weight

## Task
Find difference in number of 1-bits between two 4-bit numbers.

## Input
Two numbers A, B (0 ≤ A,B ≤ 15).

## Output
Absolute difference in bit counts.

## Examples
Input:
7
8
Output:
2

Input:
15
0
Output:
4

Input:
5
6
Output:
1

## Constraints
- Use only Module_1 concepts: arithmetic operations, modulo, integer division, digit extraction.
- No loops, no conditionals, no lists/tuples/dicts/sets, no user-defined functions.
- Prefer integer math (`//`, `%`) and arithmetic identities over any form of branching.
