# Title: Alternating Digit Product
# Topic Tags: alternating, digit

## Task
For a four-digit number, calculate: (first × third) - (second × fourth).

## Input
A four-digit integer N (treat numbers with fewer digits as having leading zeros).

## Output
The alternating product difference.

## Examples
Input:
1234
Output:
-10

Input:
5678
Output:
-13

Input:
99
Output:
0

## Constraints
- Use only Module_1 concepts: arithmetic operations, modulo, integer division, digit extraction.
- No loops, no conditionals, no lists/tuples/dicts/sets, no user-defined functions.
- Prefer integer math (`//`, `%`) and arithmetic identities over any form of branching.
