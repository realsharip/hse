# Title: Spiral Staircase Steps
# Topic Tags: spiral, staircase

## Task
A spiral staircase has N steps per full rotation. After climbing S steps, how many degrees have you rotated?

## Input
Two integers: N (steps per rotation), S (steps climbed).

## Output
Degrees rotated (integer).

## Examples
Input:
10
25
Output:
900

Input:
8
12
Output:
540

Input:
12
30
Output:
900

## Constraints
- Use only Module_1 concepts: arithmetic operations, modulo, integer division, digit extraction.
- No loops, no conditionals, no lists/tuples/dicts/sets, no user-defined functions.
- Prefer integer math (`//`, `%`) and arithmetic identities over any form of branching.
