## 📋 Task Description

A spiral staircase has N steps per full rotation. After climbing S steps, how many degrees have you rotated?
## 📥 Input Format

Two integers: N (steps per rotation), S (steps climbed).
## 📤 Output Format

Degrees rotated (integer).
## 💡 Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**
```
10
25
```

**Output:**
```
900
### Example 2

**Input:**
```
8
12
```

**Output:**
```
540
### Example 3

**Input:**
```
12
30
```

**Output:**
```
900
## ⚠️ Constraints

- Use only Module_1 concepts: arithmetic operations, modulo, integer division, digit extraction.
- No loops, no conditionals, no lists/tuples/dicts/sets, no user-defined functions.
- Prefer integer math (`//`, `%`) and arithmetic identities over any form of branching.

## 🎯 Solution Approach

This exercise focuses on **spiral, staircase** concepts from Module 1. Remember to use only:

- ✅ Basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `//`, `%`, `**`)
- ✅ Input/output functions (`input()`, `print()`, `int()`, `str()`)
- ✅ String operations (concatenation, repetition, slicing)
- ✅ Mathematical reasoning and arithmetic identities

- ❌ **No loops** (`for`, `while`)
- ❌ **No conditionals** (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- ❌ **No collections** (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets)
- ❌ **No user-defined functions**
