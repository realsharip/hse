## ⚠️ Constraints

- Use only Module_1 concepts: arithmetic operations, modulo, integer division, digit extraction.
- No loops, no conditionals, no lists/tuples/dicts/sets, no user-defined functions.
- Prefer integer math (`//`, `%`) and arithmetic identities over any form of branching.

## 🎯 Solution Approach

This exercise focuses on **train, crossing** concepts from Module 1. Remember to use only:

- ✅ Basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `//`, `%`, `**`)
- ✅ Input/output functions (`input()`, `print()`, `int()`, `str()`)
- ✅ String operations (concatenation, repetition, slicing)
- ✅ Mathematical reasoning and arithmetic identities

- ❌ **No loops** (`for`, `while`)
- ❌ **No conditionals** (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- ❌ **No collections** (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets)
- ❌ **No user-defined functions**
