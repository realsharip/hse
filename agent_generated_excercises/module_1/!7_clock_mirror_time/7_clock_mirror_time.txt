# Title: Clock Mirror Time
# Topic Tags: clock, mirror

## Task
Find the mirror time of a clock reading (mirror across 6:00-12:00 axis). For H:M, mirror is (12-H):(60-M) adjusted for valid time.

## Input
Two integers: H (1-12), M (0-59).

## Output
Mirror time as two integers: hours and minutes.

## Examples
Input:
3
15
Output:
8 45

Input:
6
0
Output:
6 0

Input:
12
30
Output:
11 30

## Constraints
- Use only Module_1 concepts: arithmetic operations, modulo, integer division, digit extraction.
- No loops, no conditionals, no lists/tuples/dicts/sets, no user-defined functions.
- Prefer integer math (`//`, `%`) and arithmetic identities over any form of branching.
