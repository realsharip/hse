# Title: Moon Phase Calculator
# Topic Tags: moon, phase

## Task
Simplified moon phase: cycle is 29 days. Day D since new moon, what phase? 0-7=new, 8-14=first quarter, 15-21=full, 22-29=last quarter.

## Input
Day D since new moon.

## Output
Phase number: 0=new, 1=first quarter, 2=full, 3=last quarter.

## Examples
Input:
5
Output:
0

Input:
10
Output:
1

Input:
17
Output:
2

## Constraints
- Use only Module_1 concepts: arithmetic operations, modulo, integer division, digit extraction.
- No loops, no conditionals, no lists/tuples/dicts/sets, no user-defined functions.
- Prefer integer math (`//`, `%`) and arithmetic identities over any form of branching.
